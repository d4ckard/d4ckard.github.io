Hey ðŸ‘‹, glad to see you here.

I'm a programmer and software developer from Germany interested in the entire stack.
My goal is to improve my understanding of differnet problem spaces as much as I can.
I've put my knowledge to work, building numerous projects ranging from embedded programming
up to user-facing web services.

You can find me here.
