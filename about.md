Hey ðŸ‘‹, glad to see you here.

I'm a programmer and software developer from Germany, interested in the entire stack.
I strive to understand complex problems.
I've put my knowledge to work, building numerous projects ranging from embedded programming
up to user-facing web services.

I'm looking for people to work with. Feel free to reach out!
