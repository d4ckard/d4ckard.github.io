Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm glad to see you here.

I'm a programmer and student from Germany. I'm drawn to the joy and excitement of discovery, and I try to build some interesting things along the way, too. Currently, I'm mostly interested  in programming languages, debuggers, DevTools, and other sorts of relatively low-level topics.

Here, I write about different things I learn along the way, problems I solve, or other potentially only semi-related thoughts I have.

You can find the things I build on my [GitHub profile]({{ site.social[1].url }}). The fastest way to contact me is probably over [Discord]({{ site.social[3].url }}) or <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">email</a>.

I still got to school and will graduate only next year. I am looking for opportunities on what to do next. Feel free to reach out, even just to chat : D
