Hey ðŸ‘‹, glad to see you here.

I'm a programmer and software developer from Germany, interested in the entire stack and I strive to understand complex problems.
I've put my knowledge to work, building numerous projects ranging from embedded programming
up to user-facing web services.

You can find things I build on my [GitHub profile]({{ site.social[1].url }}). The fastest way to contact me is probably over [Discord]({{ site.social[3].url }}).

I'm looking for people to work with. Feel free to reach out!

The title of this blog is inspired by [this great first paragraph](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3) of the introduction to the third chapter of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
