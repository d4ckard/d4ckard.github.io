Hey ðŸ‘‹, glad to see you here.

I'm a programmer and computer person from Germany, interested in the most of the stack and I strive to understand complex problems.
I've put my knowledge to work, building numerous projects ranging from embedded programming
up to user-facing web services.
In addition to that, I love math and computer science in general. I'm drawn to the joy and excitement of discovery. This is why I am a pretty quick learner, able to pick up now concepts and technologies in no time at all.

You can find things I build on my [GitHub profile]({{ site.social[1].url }}). The fastest way to contact me is probably over [Discord]({{ site.social[3].url }}) or <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">email</a>.

I'm looking for people to work with. Feel free to reach out!

The title of this blog is inspired by [this great first paragraph](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/Chapter-3.xhtml#Chapter-3) of the introduction to the third chapter of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
